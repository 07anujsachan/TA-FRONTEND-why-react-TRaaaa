#### Movie App

So before going into React let's try to understand the problem it solves. To do that we will be making a small application using vanilla JavaScript named "Movie Watch List App"

#### Requirements

- User can enter a movie name
- If user press enter the movie name will be added to the list below
- Each movie will have status (either watched or to watch)
- Default status will be `To Watch`
- Clicking on button should change the state form `To Watch` to `Watched` or vice versa.
- You will find all the instruction in the file named `TODO.md` inside `code` folder.
